# INTRODUCTION
This project delved into scrutinizing property prices in Bangalore with the aid of the house_price.csv dataset. The focal point was on assessing the price per square foot and detecting outliers through various methodologies including mean, percentile, interquartile range, normal distribution, and Z-score analysis. Leveraging these diverse approaches offered a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's distribution and any anomalous observations therein. Additionally, employing visualization techniques such as box plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps, and scatter plots facilitated a more intuitive exploration of the data, enabling the identification of trends, patterns, and potential correlations among variables. By combining analytical methods with visualizations, this project aimed to provide a multifaceted perspective on property price dynamics in Bangalore. Such insights are invaluable for stakeholders in the real estate sector, offering actionable intelligence for decision-making processes related to property investment, pricing strategies, and market trends. Ultimately, this analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the nuances within Bangalore's real estate market landscape, facilitating more informed and data-driven decision-making.
